iOSStyleEditText
=============================
In Android, the Emoji images are black and white. They look not quite beautiful. In iOS devices, the Emoji images are much better. So this project is to support the iOS Emoji Style EditText. When an Emoji character is typed, the iOS Style Emoji image will be displayed in real time.

The images are from here: https://github.com/github/gemoji.
